# gh-action-semantic-version-tag-bump
Github action to bump version w.r.t semantic versioning rules. I will update the package.json and create a tag for it

It is forked from [phips28/gh-action-bump-version](https://github.com/phips28/gh-action-bump-version).

This Action bumps the version in package.json and pushes it back to the repo.

It is meant to be used on every successful merge to master or to run on schedule, but you'll need to configured that workflow yourself. 
You can look to the [`.github/workflows/autopublish.yml`](/.github/workflows/autopublish.yml) file in this project as an example.

## Workflow

* Based on the commit messages, increment the version from the latest release.
  * If the string `Breaking change`, `major` is found anywhere in any of the commit messages or descriptions the major version will be incremented.
  * If a commit message begins with the string "feat" or includes "minor" then the minor version will be increased. This works for most common commit metadata for feature additions: `feat: new API` and `feature: new API`.
  * If a commit message contains the word "pre-alpha" or "pre-beta" or "pre-rc" then the pre-release version will be increased (for example specifying pre-alpha: 1.6.0-alpha.1 -> 1.6.0-alpha.2 or, specifying pre-beta: 1.6.0-alpha.1 -> 1.6.0-beta.0)
  * All other changes will increment the patch version.
* Push the bumped npm version in package.json back into the repo.
* Push a tag for the new version back into the repo.

### Outputs

Property | Description | Type | Example
-|-|-|-
`newVersion` | New version number | `string` | `v1.2.0`
`bumped` | Whether a version bump was performed | `boolean` as `string` | `true` or `false`

You may use those outputs in conditions for workflow steps:

```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-node@v2
  if: steps.version-bump.outputs.bumped == 'true'
  with:
    node-version: '12.x'
    registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org'
- run: npm ci
  if: steps.version-bump.outputs.bumped == 'true'
- name: 'Publish to npm'  
  run: npm publish --access=public
  if: steps.version-bump.outputs.bumped == 'true'
  env:
    NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
